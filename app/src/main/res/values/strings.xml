    <string name="bio">Contrary to popular belief, <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is not simply random text. It has
        roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
        of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
        the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"<i>de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</i>\" (The Extremes of
        Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
        very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b>, \"<i>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</i>\",
        comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

        \n\nThe standard chunk of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
        interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"<i>de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</i>\" by Cicero are
        also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
        translation by H. Rackham.\n\n</string>
